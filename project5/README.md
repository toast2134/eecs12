# Project 5 - Cityscape Game

## Description
This is the final program of the course. It combines all topics along with some new ones. The general concept is still the same,
except this program is a game where cars are randomly generated and the objective is to click on the cars as they move.
There is a score counter, which keeps track of how many vehicles of each color that have been clicked.
