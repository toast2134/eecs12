# Project 2 - Lucas Series and Fibonacci Sequence Calculations

### Description
This program calculates the nth terms of each series and prints them in consequential order.
<br />
The program also calculates the golden ratio and the % error of calculating the golden ratio using the Fibonacci sequence by dividing the F(n) and F(n-1)
<br />
The last calculation is calculating the sum of F(n-k) and F(n+k) and also calculating the product the L(k) and F(n).
<br />
1. K is a number between 2 and n.
2. The Fibonacci sequence is denoted by F() and the Lucas series is denoted by L().
